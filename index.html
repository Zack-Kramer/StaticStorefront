        <h2>Freedom after seven years. A boy, barely a man, awakens to a brave new world after freedom is earned through determination and tenacity. William arrives at the home of his family, the island nation of Norzon, in the city of Crosha. He has never been here, for his family were shipped off to safety before the horrors of the world could claim them like billions of others. Not that it helped them, for he was taken from the safe haven into the same chains he had just been freed from.
            As he rediscovers the world, it soon becomes evident that it is smaller than most would like it to be. Struggling with the prejudice of a world scared of change. Struggling with his demons and that of his family’s, William must prepare to persevere. Persevere against those who would wish to drag him back into chains. Persevere whether he is ready or not.
        Relying on memory, family members he’s never known, and the guilt of family friends he has never met. William will show them exactly what made him special enough to spare from death. He will depend on his own Nature given gifts, Eldritch blessings, a perturbed and inspired mind, and a fractured, singular view of an entire world.
        A novel about moving on. A story of finding yourself. A tale of discovering who you are beyond the sum of your parts. A book of family, whether or not you chose them, or if they are given to you.
